# Job Change Prediction - Python Data Analysis and Machine Learning Final Project

This is the README guide of running the source code of this project.

## To Run the Project

1. To run the Deep Learning model, simply type the following command:\
   `python3 DL.py`

2. To run the Support Vector Machine model, simply type the following command:\
   `python3 SVM.py`

3. To generate the preprocessed data, simply type the following command (encoder choices are "one_hot" or "label_encode"):\
   `python3 preprocess.py --method <encoder>`\
   We have already generated the preprocessed data for you.
